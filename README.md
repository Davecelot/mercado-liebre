# Case of study: Mercado Liebre

## What's Mercado Liebre?

Mercado Liebre is a study project developed for the first part of my Digital House's certification as Full Stack Node Developer, specifically for the HTML and CSS modules.

## What did I do?

I copied the design from Mercado Libre and some mockups provided for Digital House as part of the tasks to approve the modules about HTML and CSS.

## How much time did the project take?

The challenges/tasks were presented as we progressed with the content from the CSS and the HMTL modules. We had a month to deliver the final product.

## Step by step

- First we created the structure of files for the entire project

- Then we worked on the HTML files for the different views of Mercado Liebre: index (home), login and signup

- As we learned about CSS, we worked the CSS for the diferrent views designing mobile first so that Mercado Liebre is 100 % responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop

- To showcase the project and host it somewhere we implemented Render

- Last but not least, I migrated the entire project from HTML to a template engine (EJS) and the MVC pattern structure to modularize it. This was in addition to the required tasks, and it wasn't part of the challanges to do
